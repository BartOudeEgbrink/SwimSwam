# SwimSwam Showcase - 2D Unity Game

## Who am I?
My name is Bart and I am a 4th year Applied Computer Science student. For the minor that I am following (Creative Design and Technology) I have decided to make a 2D game about swimming. 

I have experience with programming in C, C++ and Python and I have used these languages a lot for embedded projects. For this showcase I had to use a lot of my creative skills and also had to learn the C# language that Unity uses.

## Inspiration
Swimming and sports overall are a big part of my life. I have also always wanted to try and make a video game but have never taken the time to actually do it. By combining these two things I decided to make a videogame that is about swimming. I looked at other similar games and found PunchClub, a game where you increase you stats and get stronger overtime so you can beat tougher opponents. This is also what I wanted my game to feel like, giving the player a sense of progression.

## The Game
As stated before the game is about swimming and leveling up. The player has several stats, these being: Endurance, energy and strength. There is also a money system and a day/time system. Meaning the player will have to manage their energy well and pick what they want to do. They can work for money, workout to gain stats or join competition. 

Of course there is also a swimming aspect to the game, the player moves their character by timing their A and D key presses. The better your timing the better the speed. 

Sadly, at the point of writing the game is not fully completed and ready for release.

## What I learned

I of course learned a lot about game development and Unity. Below I have listed some of the highlights.

- Pixelart Animation
- Creating assets
- How to write scalable code
- How to work with multible scenes
- I learn a lot by just doing
- UI components
